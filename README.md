### I revise the code from https://github.com/andresberejnoi/ComputerVision and turn it into counting amount of cars and motorcycles per frames.

## Things I learn in this project
### 1.Read OpenCV docs to revise authorâ€™s code to be a traffic counter.

### 2.Detect and calculate the amount of vehicles in every frame. 

### 3.Try lots of parameters about the frame to detect vehicles.
